# Product-Pulse

Product Pulse simplifies the customer feedback process. Obtaining and organizing customer feedback regarding a company's products is a time consuming process. Every customer has their own version of what they would like to see improved. This was a pain point during my time as a Software Support Specialist. 

A company can create products to be listed under their company. Customers can leave reviews, like other customers' reviews and rate the products from 1-5.
